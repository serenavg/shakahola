      <h3>Widely published as the "incident"</h3>
      <p>The Shakahola massacre was the horrific end to many loyal cult victims, and labelled as one of the worst
        cult-related tragedies in recent history. At least 300 bodies have been
        discovered, but there are predicted to be many more. Over 600 people are still missing, and their remains are
        predicted to be buried in shallow graves.
        This cult began in 2010, and ended in April of 2023 with the discovery of the starved children and deceased
        people. The bodies were found 2 hours from Malindi, a coastal tourist town in
        Kenya.</p>
      <p>The people had been following the preacher for many years, however, since 2010, his messages became more
        end-time focused. Then, near the end of the cult leader's reign, he told his followers that in order for them to
        get salvation, they had to go without food. This was the way that they would "meet Jesus". They were brainwashed
        to believe that "starvation was the key to salvation." This doomsday cult
        gained even more traction when the Covid-19 pandemic started, because it seemed as though the leaders'
        prophecies were coming true. </p>

      <h3>The Cult Leader</h3>
      <p>Paul Nthenge Mackenzie is the leader of this tragic death cult. Step by step he built up a following. He
        targeted the childern of the adults who were already in the cult, because most people would do
        anything for their kids. The parents thought Mackenzie's solutions were the best shot for their kids to have a
        good life; to achieve salvation. Children are easily manipulated as well, so that was another reason why
        Mackenzie targeted them. </p>
      <p>Ironically, he called himself the pastor of the "Good News International Church." However, earlier in the year
        he was arrested for accounts of murder of 2 children by starvation and suffocation, but, of course,
        was released on bail. After he was released, he changed the end of the world date from August 2023 to April
        2023. Then, in April, 17 people along with Mackenzie were detained and not granted bail
        for fear that releasing them could negatively impact the police investigations.
