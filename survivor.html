      <h3>Treated horribly</h3>
      <p>95 people have been rescued, yet the stories of the survivors are haunting. One man speaks of how he lost his 3
        children to this cult, the lies, the manipulation. The victims of this cult
        were promised a better life. Some were even threatened saying if they didn't follow, they would "miss the
        ark,"-a reference to the Old Testament Bible story of Noah's Ark and the Flood.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, some of the people were so indoctrinated that once they were rescued, they still refused to eat.
        What's even worse. is that these survivors were then charged with
        attempted suicide. The 65 people that were charged with that now have to deal with even more trauma. Though,
        people have criticized the Kenyan government for prosecuting these survivors,
        saying they need help and empathy instead of criminal charges. Some people are even hiding back in the forest to
        evade the authorites and these criminal charges.
